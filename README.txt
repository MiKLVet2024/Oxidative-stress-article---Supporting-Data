Description of the data and file structure* Review Data: data are presented by research fields, journal and year of publication. For each publication, the following information is provided: title, animal taxon being considered, markers of oxidative status being measured, the biological matrix where markers of oxidative status were measured, and the conditions in response to which they were measured* Meta-analysis data: data are presented for each of the three negatively-valenced conditions under consideration (social isolation, noise exposure, predation exposure). The title of each study is provided, as well as the tissue in which markers of oxidative status were measured. For each of the four markers of oxidative status that were considered here (MDA, GSH, SOD, CAT), the sample size, the mean effect and the standard deviation are provided for the control and the treatment groups.Sharing/Access informationData was derived from the following sources:* Peer-reviewed articlesCode/SoftwareR codes used for the meta-analyses and meta-regressions are provided for each marker of oxidative status (MDA, GSH, SOD, CAT) and for each negatively-valenced condition (social isolation, noise exposure, predation exposure) considered here.
